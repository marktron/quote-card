## The Problem QuoteCard Solves

People constantly discover powerful quotes, insights, and passages while reading online. They want to share these moments on Instagram, Twitter/X, LinkedIn, or in newsletters—but the process is painful:

1. **Screenshots look ugly** — Browser chrome, ads, and inconsistent formatting
2. **Canva/Figma is slow** — Opening a design tool, formatting text, choosing fonts... it kills the moment
3. **No visual consistency** — Each shared quote looks different, hurting personal brand
4. **Mobile sharing is broken** — Text copied from Safari loses all context and style

QuoteCard eliminates all of this. Three clicks: highlight, style, share.
